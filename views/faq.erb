		How do you post a picture to the site?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<br>
			It's simple really. 
			Click on the link that represents the main subject for your image (you can only pick one subject for the image). 
			Once on that page click on the "choose file" button and browse to the location of your image and click your image.
			If you want to describe or comment your image, enter in the text you want to show with your image in the "Enter Comment" section.
			Then just click "Upload" and your image should show up on the page right away.

		How do I reply to an image?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<br>
		It's very similar to adding an image to the site. 
		The difference though it that you scroll to the image you want to reply to and click the "Choose File" button under the post number you are replying to.
		Browse to the image you want to reply with (if there's an image you want to post) and/or add your comment. 
		Then click the "Reply to Post [#}" button. [#] should reflect the post number you are replying to.

		How do I view a larger image?
	</dt>
		<dd>
		<br>
		To see a larger version of an image simply click on the image you wish to view. This will bring up the image in its actual size.
		</dd>
	<dt>
		<br>
		How do you get back to the site after viewing an enlarged image?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<br>
			Currently when clicking on an image that image opens directly in the tab/window you were viewing. This means that to get back to the site you will need to click the browser's back button to get back to the site. A future update will address this and allow enlarged images to load in a new tab/window.
